## How to run
First Install **Processing**: http://processing.org
Open'main.pyde'in **Python Mode**
Click **Run**
The sketch will saves a static output to 'output_image.png' via 'saveFrame()

## Feature
This program uses methods such as pixel sampling, color gradient, and custom functions to achieve the display of the final product.
The pixel-driven generation logic is also very clear. It converts the image into a data structure, enabling each image to generate different visual effects.
The lattice distribution technique employed here exhibits a natural diffusion, giving it a unique generative quality. The combination of randomness and visual art in its presentation adds a dynamic vitality to the image.
